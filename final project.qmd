## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-one
#| tbl-cap: "Descriptive statistics"
library(gtsummary)
load(here::here("covid_testing.rda"))
table1 <- tbl_summary(
  covid_testing,
  by = gender,
  include = c(gender, pan_day, drive_thru_ind, orderset, demo_group, age, ct_result,
							payor_group, result, patient_class))
table1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
drive_thru_f <- inline_text(table1, variable = "drive_thru_ind", 
                         column = "female")
drive_thru_m <- inline_text(table1, variable = "drive_thru_ind", 
                         column = "male")
```

More female (`r drive_thru_f`) participants choose to collect specimen via a drive-thru site than male (`r drive_thru_m`) participants.

```{r}
#| label: fig-hist
#| fig-cap: "This is a histogram of number of day after start of pandemic"
hist(covid_testing$pan_day,main = "Histogram of day after pandemic start", xlab = "days")
```

@fig-hist contains the day after start of pandemic histogram and @tbl-one a descriptive table.

```{r}
orderset_f <- inline_text(table1, variable = "orderset", 
                         column = "female")
orderset_m <- inline_text(table1, variable = "orderset", 
                         column = "male")
payor_f <- inline_text(table1, variable = "payor_group", level="government",
                         column = "female")
payor_m <- inline_text(table1, variable = "payor_group", level="government",
                         column = "male")
```

I saved the dataset from this github: https://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata/tree/master/data. This data set is from Amrom E. Obstfeld, who de-identified data on COVID-19 testing during the year 2020 at the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania (aka CHOP). This study is a prospective cross-sectional cohort. This data set contains data concerning testing for SARS-CoV2 via PCR as well as associated metadata. The data has been anonymized, time-shifted, and permuted.This data set contains data on SARS-CoV2 testing at a single hospital on. There are 15,524 participants (7832 female and 7692 male) were tested, from day 4 to day 107 of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset shows that a less proportion of female (`r orderset_f`) use order set for test order than male (`r orderset_m`). (`r payor_f`) womens'covid-testing payor is government which is more than mens'(`r payor_m`). A greater proportion of female (`r inline_text(table1, variable = "result", level="positive",column = "female")`) than male(`r inline_text(table1, variable = "result", level="positive",column = "male")`)got positive result. A greater proportion of female (`r inline_text(table1, variable = "payor_group", level="self pay",column = "female")`) than male(`r inline_text(table1, variable = "payor_group", level="self pay",column = "male")`)choose self pay the testing.
